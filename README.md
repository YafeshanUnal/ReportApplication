## Why Used This Technologies

**Sprint Boot:** The Spring library is one of the most well-known libraries in the Java world and you can easily find a lot of information about it. That's why I chose Spring for my project.

**Maven:** Project requires maven to run without IDE configurations.

**Spring Security:** Spring Security is essential for the login-registration system. I can manage which roles can access which pages. Using Spring Security is very simple and it is the main security library for Spring.

**Thymeleaf:** I didn't know Thymeleaf exactly, I had react and plain html in mind, but Thymeleaf made my job much easier compared to others, I saved time.

**Bootstrap:** An easy to use and fast library in the current Css world, I have used it in this project as I have worked on it before.
